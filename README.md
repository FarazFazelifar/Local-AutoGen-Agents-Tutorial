# Local AutoGen Agents Tutorial
Tutorial on how to use AutoGen without the OpenAI API and with local Ollama models.

# Why was this tutorial created?
AutoGen uses the OpenAI API to power its various agents. This approach, while viable for many cases, has a lot of problems. First of all, it could be costly. secondly, not everyone can access the OpenAI API or may choose not to use it.

Therefore, I created this tutorial to show how to launch our local models through Ollama and integrate them with AutoGen.
